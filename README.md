# For working details only (Not Required for use)
Working of this is simple,   
A tesseract script reads all the files (tess.py) in the data dir to create a jsonl file 'output.jsonl'.  
Then, this file is accessed by a script running Adaptive-RAG on Gemini 1.5 Pro and Embedder is text-embedder-004 (app.py)  
Use of Pathway library is extensive and most of the functions used are inbuilt functions of pathway library
